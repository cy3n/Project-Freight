# Project-Freight
Freight delays are common disruptions in supply chain operations, which could lead to lag time in production and as a result: potential loss revenue. They also have large economic impacts, such as increased operating expenses in the form of labor, operating and inventory costs, and increased capital expenditure.

We were curious to study how these freight delays, caused by traffic congestion, have an impact on supply chains, especially the time taken for goods to arrive from a loading bay to the assembly factory. 

In our project, we aim to simulate the time delivery trucks take to deliver car parts to a factory while considering traffic congestion on the road. We will use JaamSim to conduct Discrete Time Simulation to simulate the traffic flow, and the trucks will be used to deliver the car parts from the airport's loading dock to the factory. 

In this simulation, we define the traffic generated by queues formed near the traffic junction. In the simulation, we created 2 traffic junction, to mirror reality as vehicles need to wait before crossing.

By studying the relationship between the time taken to deliver parts and vehicles, we hope to provide insights into how traffic congestion can be mitigated to improve supply chain efficiency.
